This is currently not working. The same errors keep occurring when I mess with it, something to this effect:


[Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '../db/db.json'] {
  errno: -2,
  code: 'ENOENT',
  syscall: 'open',
  path: '../db/db.json'
}

Need the chance to go over this with someone!! Might be doing too much w the fs.read/write etc...
